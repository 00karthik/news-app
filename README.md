I have used React with Antd framework;

Through this project I have implemented state management using context api, responsive design, fetching Geo location and default browser language.

I have implemented custom hooks to call the weather and news api.

The components are in a plain structure since its a small project

Added loaders for a smooth UI

Also used react-router to pass the search parameter to the news API. (This was done to demonstrate the use of react router).

To run the project

## npm install
## npm start

The project can be viewed on
